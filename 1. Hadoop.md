# Hadoop Components:
1. Distributed Storage: HDFS
2. Distributed Processing: MapReduce

## Problems before hadoop: 
- Centralized Storage (vertical scaling)
- Centralized Processing (slow)

## Design considerations for hadoop:
- Distributed Storage
  1. Distributed
  2. Fault tolerance: Automatically detect and recover from fault & hence can use commodity hardware
  3. High avaiabilty
  4. Scalability: horizontal scaling
  5. Streaming Data Access: Write Once Read Many
  6. Immutable: no arbitrary modifications to file (add at end or truncate)
- Distributed Processing
