# HDFS (Hadoop Distributeed File System) 
It is used for distributed storage on a cluster of commodity hardware.

## Features of HDFS:
- Distributed
- Scalability: Add machine to increase storage capacity (horizontal scaling) because of distributed
- Fault Tolerance: 
  1. Chunks/Blocks can be served from other slave node in case of slave node failure
  2. Standby master node in case of master node failure
  3. Parallel runing master node (hadoop 3) in case of master node failure
- High Availability: Because of fault tolerance
- Streaming Data Access: Write Once Read Many (stream read/access of files)
- Immutability: No arbitrary modifications to the file (add at the end or truncate)

## HDFS is built on master/slave architecture. Its components are:
- NameNode (Master)
  1. Stores metadata (timestamps, state, access control lists, etc.) of files and directories stored in HDFS: via INode data structure
  2. Stores a list of healthy DataNodes
  3. Regulates access/denial of files
  4. Regulates which blocks and replicas will be handled by which DataNode
- DataNode (Slave)
  1. Block creation, deletion, replication
  2. Periodically (deafult is 3 sec) sends hearbeats to NameNode
  3. Periodically sends block report to NameNode
  
  **Note**: NameNode does not connect to DataNode directly for instructions (client does this after receiving metadata from Namenode)
  
## How to store files:
1. Files are split into chunks/blocks (chunk/block is of size 64 MB or 128 MB (can be configured))
2. Chunks/Blocks are stored on different node in the cluster
3. Chunks/Blocks are replicated across clusters based on replication factor (can be configured)

**Note**: The entire process of storing files is abstracted.
